# Photo-Game
A simple game that uses C# 
The game has 10 pictures, 5 pairs of 2 same pictures, of car manufacturers and they're turned so you don't see them. Them, you're supposed to click the 2 same pictures while being turned back,
once you click the 2 same pictures, they disappear. 
When you have clicked all the correct pictures the game finishes and saves your number of tries to a leaderboard you can find in the main menu.
First, you're promted to add your username and then to add a picture of yours to click, instead of a car manufacturers'. Then the game begins...
Head into the PhotoGame folder and then into bin/debug/PhotoGame.exe to run the program and make sure you've downloaded all the files because if not, an exception will rise.
Have fun!
